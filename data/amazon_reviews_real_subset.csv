5.0,Neon pink.,"Nice formula, smooth application with no pooling or shink back. I used three coats, which is pretty standard for me. I'm not sure you could get away with two as I did have a bit of streaking.

1.0,There are better options.,When it came to me one of the shadows was broken. Powder was everywhere on all of the shadows for the price it is ok.

5.0,Tiny bottle - Great for Gua Sha massage,[[VIDEOID:9dead00b25249e454e9ac285069262fb]] To my surprise- This is a tiny bottle of Jasmine Vital Oil. Very tiny like 4 ml.<br /><br />I have previously used products from Clarks Botanicals & I seem to like the subtlety of their products. This particular oil I use for my gua sha routine every other night.<br /><br />It absorbs very well into the skin & the gua sha easily glides on my facial skin. The oil is kinda runny & has no fragrance!<br /><br />But sadly it will last for a few days only! Gotta buy more.,B0BTTNDWXB,AGMILXKKGL53FK7VAFS7QU2ZAW2A,2023-03-11 03:30:02.902

Not a counterfeit,"Most reviewers are stating either it's half empty or clumpy, you have to keep in mind that the pictures only look like the cream is tilted to the side. It had to be mixed.

5.0,"WOW, I'm impressed","I'll be honest - for the price, I wasn't expecting much. I bought this thinking that if the tool for cleaning under the toenails was usable and didn't snap off the first time I used it, I'd consider it a win.<br />I can honestly say I'm blown away by the quality of these items. They're heavy and solid, and appear to have no plastic whatsoever (other than the grips on the clippers). They actually feel like quality dental or medical tools in terms of weight, finish, and balance. The nippers are strong, sharp, precise, and perfectly aligned. They require a bit of getting used to for using, but they snipped even my thick old gnarly big toenail with almost no effort. They worked pretty well on dead skin/calluses too, but to be honest they're so sharp I'm afraid to try much with that - I'll just stick to the cuticle removing tool, which is also sharp if somewhat less easy to use on my own toes (works great on my fingers though).<br /><br />I am extremely impressed - these would be a value at even twice or three times the price.",B07RZJHBKT,AGBWX3ARGERGXLX3T4YYJKSTCTCQ,2019-06-11 17:29:17.371

Worth it!,"I saw these makeup brushes and I was scared to buy them and get them in and they would feel like little girls toy makeup brushes but they were heavy, the bristles were just like makeup-pro brushes.

5.0,Very pleased - with a few quirks,"I am usually a clip in hair extension girl, but thought I would give these a try. These were supy easy to install, i have very fine hair, not very thick so only took about 3 hours to do. I bought three packs of the 16/22 piano color highlight blonde. I am giving them 4 stars because one pack i bought, some of the holes in the pieces of hair where my hair goes through were not big enough so I couldn't even use those pieces of hair, it was obviously a bad batch. Also, the beads are very light colored and you can see them easily when you pull your hair back, should be a tad darker. I could return them I suppose, but  I dont know how to go about doing that when I used some of the good ones that were in the box. Might ask for a partial refund. but other than that these look really good, I might have to move some around so they dont show but again this is my first time doing something like this other than clip ins, so I think it looks pretty good. I can tug on them and brush them without them falling out.",B01HBARSRE,AEHY3PURYMKSN2VFS6LZP4QMOORA,2019-03-08 13:47:20.317
4.0,"Burns a bit, not completely waterproof, but good overall.","I like this liquid liner for the most part but I do notice a burning sensation after applying. It doesn't burn for very long though and it is definitely manageable for me. I like that the tip stays moist without allowing too much liner to seep out. The tip is precise and easy to apply. I also like that I can make a bold or thin line as well. This seems to be fairly water resistant but I wouldn't say that its fully waterproof. It doesn't run when I'm sweating but it did run a bit when splashed with water. I like that it's made in the USA and cruelty free as well. I've only used it on my natural lashes as I don't have false lashes so I can't say if it works with them or not. All in all, I'm pleased with this product and would buy it again in the future.",B071LLTN9H,AG3FVTSD7ISLKALIPY24IVJCCDTA,2020-09-09 21:08:18.795
5.0,Just what I wanted,These combs are just what I wanted - they clip the hair up but still leave some length showing. Can be used in a couple of ways to be creative with twisting hair around the combs. And was fast delivery. Thanks,B07WMMM753,AGFHIC2TANXYE2D7WFCCGXSM6TNA,2020-02-10 05:53:52.942

5.0,Perfect for my Coastal Scents palette!!,"I love that these are the exact size of the Nyx hot singles eyeshadow refills, and I love how clean they came in the package.<br /><br />Before I got these I had a mishmash of messy depotted pans that were bent and flimsy and had to be glued down because they weren't reactive to a magnet, but now that I've transferred all of the colors into these new pans my palette looks much neater, (and I may add a dot of glue just to be safe), but my pans are much more secure.

5.0,Perfect appliance solution,"I use my flat iron, electric hot comb and curling irons with this product. I've constantly worried about the damages my vanity table or the the toilet top would take if I placed my hot hair appliances on them. (The top of the toilet when I had no bathroom counter space BEFORE I got my vanity table.) This mat definitely put me at ease with that. I often need to leave the house right after styling my hair but with my cat running around, I always worried he would knock it down and get hurt. I used to unplug it and leave it on the kitchen counter and close the door so he couldn't get to it. With the mat I can put my still hot appliance it it, wrap up the cord around it and put it right back in the drawer where I keep all my hair appliances and not worry about any damages. It's definitely a wise purchase and worth the money (which is reasonably priced in my opinion).",B002ARK308,AHP2TJUIU5C233MWNVWUXOYYIP2Q,2011-07-17 22:52:01.000

I love the way it feels and how bouncy the hair is and how FULL the bundles are.  I ordered 4 bundles (16, 18, 20, 22) because I felt that I would get more for my money.  (I ordered a separate closure here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EE9NQBM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 - and the colors and wave pattern are the same).  I took several picture so you ladies can really see the hair.  The picture with the little strands on the white paper is from me running my hands through each bundle about 10-15 times.  This is all that came out.  I did find one plastic hair (pictured below). I would highly recommend this hair but plan to do another review after install.",B019N8W1YM,AFHHJJOQBWF5ALBYM3WZQK4HOQRA,2017-01-17 01:04:58.000

5.0,GREAT PRODUCT from a newbie!,I have had this product for a month now and am new to epilation.  I love the light!  It really is a must have.  My legs are becoming more used to this process and it is true that it doesn't hurt near as much.  I also ordered Burt's Bees powder to make the hair stand up more prior to epilation.  I usually do it dry unless I happen to be in the shower which I don't think the results are as good.  Then afterwards I use Rosemary tonic water with aloe to reduce the bumps.  My legs are getting more and more smooth.  At first I would notice many bumps and they are becoming less with a much smoother result.  My hair is very curly and therefore coarse.  So happy with the results as shaving grows back by evening time if I shave in the morning.  I still shave if I'm in a hurry but I like the choice!,B00AX3YNPC,AEUJTNGCJOGVIBWI7DQC3JBYSQMA,2015-05-14 16:33:32.000

4.0,Great for switching colors on your eye-shadow brushes! Cleaning mat makes cleaning brushes a breeze!,I've been wanting a color switch kit for some time now and this kit did not disappoint. I almost got just the tin with the sponge before for the same price but this set also included a brush (great for packing shadow on the lid or running color along the lower lash line) and a brush cleaner mat with it is amazing (you can hold it while swirling wet brushes on it or suction it to the sink while cleaning). I love this set since it is difficult to find the same kind of material inside the tin to do a DIY version.

5.0,AWSOME PRODUCT FOR THE MALTESE BREED,"I watch a video about grooming a maltese and they were promoting purepaws. I looked it up online. My first thought was that it was kinda of expensive for a dog shampoo and conditioner. I have 5 month old maltese and matted hair was becoming a huge problem for her and me. I had tried several different dog shampoos and conditioners but to no avail. My little dog hair's was dried and matted even though I brushed her hair every other day.This product here is wonderful. Now brush, combing, and blow drying her hair is a breeze. Even when she jumps in our swimming pool filled harsh chemicals. Three hours later, her hair is still soft and manable. I am not sure if this product will work for every breed but for a pure breed maltese I can guarantee the outcome will be pleasing.",B0035TU8B4,AESYPTBEEC76JEOYLEZYPF6D4W5Q,2011-07-31 17:49:39.000

This works great for self treatment.  I usually use it with a little bit of analgesic lotion. These aren't as rough as more traditional guasha tools.

5.0,Exactly what I wanted,"Highly pigmented, doesn't smear or break me out, does transfer a bit (I have very hooded eyes) but is easy to clean up, does well enough in the waterline, a little goes a long way actually and I'm still learning to only pick up what I actually need since I use this for eyes and brows (mostly brows), has decent hold, this product is a bit shiny but I just lightly pat what's left of my setting powder over it and I'm good all day, does seem to have stained my white synthetic brush a bit gray after washing it off after a week of use, plays well over eyebrow pencil and under eyebrow powder/ eye shadow. Haven't tried it as mascara, but I've heard it works for that but isn't super dramatic like I like, so maybe one day if I ever have a clean spooly. I'm looking forward to trying the rest of the line.",B01N5DN3GF,AFH6K3MD4KLAYSUWQLTAI5WQMUUA,2018-02-18 06:12:28.996

5.0,I always thought something like this would be great to have,"I always thought something like this would be great to have, but I never thought of it as an aid for sleep. I always thought of it more along the lines of listening to something while outdoors in the winter. I bought these for my daughter and mind you it is July and she is wearing in the house and at bed time to make her fall asleep better. I would have just used some headphones and wrapped my arm around my head, but whatever. These are pretty decent sounding, but it is just music coming out. Not like a beautiful symphony is playing in your head with full immersion in the music. I still think these would be good for shoveling the driveway in the winter. But since she has the headphones in the headband she will have to shovel all of the snow, because I am not wearing a lavender headband, lol. This a nice product and a great idea. **I received this product at a discount in exchange for a fair, honest and unbiased review.

5.0,Satisfying BB cushion and very cute,"I have dry skin with mild rosacea, and this was pretty comfortable for me over my usual moisturizer, not itchy or irritating, and didn't catch on dry patches or anything. This definitely isn't the product to get if you want heavy coverage, but it lightly evened out my skin and that was what I wanted it to do. I'm pale with freckles and the second shade was good on me. The packaging is the real draw here, and it's absolutely as cute as it looks in the pictures and very fun to shake to see the ""sprinkles"" roll around.",B07D7R6J6N,AE3Q3SASN43EHMWNEMFCFJZTWIXQ,2018-09-08 16:27:32.451

Keeps my lips soft and doesn't feel greasy or sticky, which I love.  I was using the Burt's Bees tinted lip balms but didn't like the way they tasted and it felt like it was just kind of sitting on my lips, not actually soaking in.

4.0,Smushed bristles.,"The issue is that the brush side of both of them (I ordered 2.) was crushed so about half of the bristles on one and about a third on the other one were all smushed down and even after using them for a while it has not helped them pop back up and stand as that side is supposed to. It seems to work just fine more or less but I was hoping that with some use that they would right themselves to be a bit more effective (possibly?) but it hasn‚Äôt happened.<br />Just something to be mindful of if you order them, because it was like that on both of the ones I received.",B08GX39DY1,AHTQZRAJSW4XG5NY3FGJSMMWYFOQ,2021-08-01 19:06:22.493

I'll probably try the next shade when the Fall returns and it's very dry and cold again for 6 months!  Could easily be built up to a medium coverage where needed. I would not build it beyond medium personally as it might look artificial.,B07D13NN2Y,AGIHZSMT3DQQMZZ357JWQHPF42PQ,2019-05-15 12:29:08.958

5.0,Worth it,I'm glad I bought these. So colorful and so many options. A lot of bands I'll have them for a few years. They are more stretchy then I'm use to. But they hold and don't snap as easily.

3.0,Yes they are soft but maybe to soft,"I will give it to them it is very very soft but I don't think they're packed as densely as they should be,  to be efficient , especially the face brushes I mean they are baby soft smooth on your skin but it's almost too soft because there's not enough bristles there.  I think if they were packed more densely these could be phenomenal brushes, I would even pay double the price even triple the price of these were packed correctly whatever they're using is beautiful but they're not using enough of them. Im sadden by this cuz these could be a holy grail for a lot of people looking for good brushes at a better price point",B093K5K6SR,AEJVJLFL6Y6JMIETDDA62EWQ3CUQ,2021-09-13 20:24:29.965

5.0,I love it,"I love this comb. Carbon combs don't bend and break like ordinary plastic combs which means you can actually carefully comb knots out rather than tearing out chunks of hair.

5.0,Eye Replacement Head Fits Glo Pro Perfectly & Makes It Easier To Use Glo Pro In Eye Area,"I‚Äôm using the Glo Pro eye attachment head with my Glo Pro that I bought from a department store that included only the face attachment head. The eye head is slimmer and less than half the width with just four rows of needles. The eye head is an authentic and high quality attachment that snaps on easily and fits Glo Pro perfectly. I definitely prefer using this slimmer eye head for the delicate area around my eyes and between my brows and even my forehead (which is small). The smaller head gives me better control and greater ease of using Glo Pro in small areas.<br /><br />I wasn‚Äôt sure of the boundaries around my eye area, so I emailed Glo Pro and was informed the eye head can be used right up to the bottom lashes (but not on the eye lids).  Still, this device is new to me so for now I don‚Äôt go much beyond the orbital bone- where I apply my night time eye cream.  The Glo Pro needles are short and feel just a little prickly and give me a slight burning sensation. But it‚Äôs not uncomfortable or painful and hasn‚Äôt caused any excessive redness or irritation. I definitely recommend the smaller eye attachment head for Glo Pro users and rate it 5 stars.<br /><br />I wasn‚Äôt provided a Glo Pro device and this review is only of the eye attachment head.  Still, I‚Äôm sure people wonder if Glo Pro works. I‚Äôve used a Glo Pro about a month, twice a week, and don‚Äôt feel I‚Äôve used it long enough to know.  I‚Äôm in my 50‚Äôs and my skin does happen to look good lately.  I don‚Äôt see dramatic changes, but my skin seems firmer and my fine lines around my eyes and elsewhere seem less noticeable. But I feel I need to use Glo Pro longer to decide if it‚Äôs the device, my skin care products or both that are providing a benefit. I do like Glo Pro enough to keep using it.",B06XD3SXQ8,AE3PLZHW6NXWBMZ76TDVFQG2MJFA,2018-10-18 15:57:27.619

2.0,SMALL scrunchies,These scrunchies are cheaply made and small. The elastic barely stretches in order to wrap the hair twice.  These were definitely made cheap and quality is poor.

When I use them, I feel like the sheets slip & slide on my face. When I use the USA version, the sheet will actually absorb and stay in place. The price of 3 for $11 should have been a red flag, as the Clean & Clear sheets are $6.99 each at my local store.",B01GPS1OS2,AHNANZOBRXTKSUTY3AN3ZX2EAMDA,2020-09-12 19:47:45.444
5.0,I am very happy that I found this product,I was very surprised when I receive this product to find that it didn't have that strong offensive smell that you get with polish remover. Because it didn't have that distinct smell of acetone that I expected my first thought was that it would not work. I soon found that I was wrong. I am very happy that I found this product. I have been looking for something that is more gentle on my skin and I love that this product is all natural. It works well with removing polish but it does take longer than an acetone-based polish. I receive this polish remover as a promotion. If you're looking for a natural polish remover that is gentle on your skin and does not have an offensive smell this is the product for you.,B01AYTGWA8,AF2Y6RGLF6BS3QPSWLTYZZGBTNQQ,2016-04-18 05:35:29.000
1.0,Quality has gone way down,"Update: It has been shedding a lot, I've never had shedding like this before. Just put it on this morning and when I lightly rand my fingers down through it, with 0 resistance, a handful of hair came out.<br /><br />I was so in love with this wig, I've bought it about 4 times and it usually lasts 3-4 months before it's completey dried out and not taking any softener. This latest purchase, I just starting wearing it 4 days ago and I'm unimpressed. I don't know if I received a bad one or if the quality has gone way down but this one doesn't have any baby hairs like the other 3 so the hairline looks painfully wiggy. It's also tangling and drying out already, meaning the fibers are lower quality. It's too bad, I was banking on this one lasting 3-4 months like the others but I would be surprised if it makes it a full month. I'm going to have to find a different wig to switch to.",B07D6V9J9D,AFZKIJGFZHGOGICHHOLG2PK65WJQ,2020-03-23 22:54:33.857

The product will add Curl or Body where you want it or Control where you need it.  Never any flaking or heavy build up.  Even keeps curls just where you want them or straight hair smooth.  Foxy Curls is the one and only for ANY type hair texture, cut  or style. A bottle last forever as it only takes a small amount to achieve the look you want.  I tend to want to purchase several bottles when I find them because I can't imagine life without Foxy Curls Spray.

5.0,Feel the burn and smell like gum.,This product is the most potent on the market. You will smell like a package of wintergreen gum and so will your clothes and bed and anywhere you go. But that one hour of fire ant burning sensation takes your mind off the back pain and you can go for a short walk or try to put on your socks or shower before you remember the cramps and spasms and numbness. I love this product. Those 30-60 minutes of burning is the relief you need. Definitely need to shake up the tube and squeeze from the end. The metal squirt tube is quality.

5.0,Super easy application,"I purchased these after leaving my entire pack of Zinka at a campsite. These are cheaper and come with more in a pack. My kids love to put this on over a regular application of sunscreen to the face. It helps with the trouble areas (nose and cheeks) during long summer days at the beach. The colors are bright, bold and the application is so much easier than squeezing zinc from a tube and rubbing it on their faces.

3.0,It‚Äôs decent :),The product is decent for non picky makeup users. It‚Äôs not long lasting or matte. It‚Äôs just a regular drug store quality makeup.

4.0,Awesome tool for those who arent professionals!!,"first off, im not sure if this is the same supplier as the one my dremel was puchased from (it was a gift). But this has to be the best dremel you can get at this price!! I give a 4 star rating because the cord that connects from the wall to the dremel is only about two feet long, so an extention cord would definitely help! Im not sure if this is some safety setting or what, but if you have the speed set high, and you apply too much pressure it will stop spinning and you will have to restart it. I personally dont mind it, but it is important to know if you are looking into something for comercial use. The different pieces are also nicely made. They only have five sand paper tube things, but they definitely last. I was able to use only one for 2 sets before it went dull.",B00Q970V5W,AEMFTZFZ4LWG2MZETG2TJ5CDABCA,2016-06-14 00:30:37.000

5.0,I am already beginning to see a difference and starting to say goodbye to‚Ä¶.,"I purchased this Coconut and Retinol Anti-Aging Facial Serum because it promotes to being able to say goodbye to forehead wrinkles, crow's feet, turkey necks, and laugh lines.  At the age of 55 I am beginning to see all of these, but I was mainly concerned about my crow‚Äôs feet and turkey neck.  Just the names sound awful, but to me they looked a lot worse before I began using it.  I have been using this product for just under 2 weeks and I am seeing a difference.  I am using it daily and I do notice that the lines/wrinkles are smoothing out.  I do not know if they will all come right back if I stopped but I like the results so far and will continue using it.  I also read another reviewer where she was applying it to her spots/freckles and I thought why not try it and the spots are definitely lighter.  I like the results that I am seeing so far and will continue to use it.<br /><br />Another big plus is that the Anti-Aging Serum only contains four ingredients, simple and pure; one is coconut and the other is Retinol.  There are no harmful chemicals used in this product and it is made in the USA.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discounted price for my unbiased and honest review and testing and am very happy with this purchase.

After two washes with soap they were fine tho. Lastly, one of them already tore. Kinda disappointed in them, but for that price, i guess you aren‚Äôt paying for quality.

3.0,"not as easy as they make it look in the video, but doable!","I am not a girly girl.  My hair care routine is wash, a little product, air dry.  Somedays, I get crazy and put it in a pony tail.  I have been trying to find different ways to get my bangs out of my face without putting all my hair up while I am growing it out.  Also I am terrible when it comes to getting a straight part.  My hair has a natural curl/wave to it and it is thick and coarse, which makes it that much harder to get it to cooperate with anything I want to do.  I watched the videos where they literally just put in the big clip and then grabbed hair, twisted and put it in the smaller clips.  Someday, I hope to be able to do it that easily.  It took me twenty minutes to get my hair to part, and then figure out where to put the big clip.  Trying to get the bangs/front of my hair to part into three equal sections and then twist them without getting the other sections of hair mixed in and then trying to get my fat fingers to open the small clips without moving the big clip....  y'all my dogs were standing at the bathroom door watching me like they were watching a puppet show.<br /><br />I got it done.  My husband says it looks nice.

I took my mouse bridge to a local plastics shop to have it cut down to a smaller size;  it works OK now, but it still tips when I move toward the outer edges, and it covers the directional arrow keys.",B0007VU9O4,AEN32SZ2ZQQPL2BQUQH72GY6FBTA,2007-05-13 18:24:18.000

5.0,Great moisturizer!,"I ordered this Retseliney Retinol Moisturizing Cream for the retinol and other natural and organic moisturizing ingredients in it. I have rough, dry and sensitive skin that desperately needs moisture. I've been using this twice a day, once at night after washing my face and again in the morning before applying make-up. I love how moisturizing it is, and I have not had any skin irritation or discomfort. It makes my skin feel so much softer without the after greasy-feel that other products sometimes give. I think it is too soon to tell if my fine lines will become less apparent, but I think moisturizing is step 1 for me.<br /><br />As I said above the ingredients are natural and organic, no hard chemicals or phosphates. Aloe, shea butter, green tea, jojoba, sunflower oil, palm oil, vitamin E and B5 are just some of the ingredients. In the past, I would never look at what chemicals were in the products I was using and putting on my skin, which absorbs into my body. I am excited that there are now so many companies looking at this to and making the change.  I received this as a complimentary sample for review and feedback purposes, the above thoughts are definitely my own and I think this is a 5 star product!",B00U3CMZXA,AG5HORHR3CG34A7TTEF57SZTEQCA,2015-11-18 18:01:52.000

5.0,Observations,"As it turns out I live only 20 miles from West Coast Shaving.  I called them and said I would drop in.  While I was there I picked up a bunch of different blades, a new boar brush and Mitchells wool fat shaving soap.  I've been wanting to try this stuff for a long time because of the reviews.  The price varies depending on where you purchase it.  I bought the refill only because it would fit perfectly in an empty shaving cream container I had.  Next time I will buy it in the ceramic bowl.  That may be a long time from now as this soap lasts forever.<br /><br />Because everyone is different and must find the best combination of razor, brush, soap and blades I will not say that this is great and that over there is terrible.  But I will make an observation.  A new boar brush must be broken in which takes a couple of weeks because the tips of the bristles seem too firm and rather sharp when it's first used.  My observation is that not only does the lanolin soften up your skin nicely but it has helped brake in the boar bruch very quickly.  The lanolin seems to soften up the brush just like it softens up your beard.  This only took about three shaves and my boar brush is perfect.<br /><br />I read all the reviews and saw the videos on this soap.  I didn't find any problems with the soap as far a lathering.  I soaked it in WARM water and took my boar brush to start to lather it up.  No problem.  I didn't find all the problems that other people talk about. This might be the results of the water hardness rather than the soap itself.",B001LY7FRK,AESOTHR7SKJ23R6ETRUPEOOBATRQ,2011-06-23 11:03:02.000

These wipes are to be deposed in the garbage not the toilet and are not to be close to your eyes. Directions state that you should place the cloth on the area that has make-up for about 5 seconds and then wipe off. The scent smells very nice and my skin did feel smooth when done.

5.0,"Not only makes clean up easy, it also gives me better food.","If you haven't gotten a silicone baking mat yet, and you use your oven AT ALL, you should really get this!<br /><br />It's incredibly easy to clean up.  It doesn't matter whether it's those cookies that always stick to your favorite cookie sheet or a gooey cheesy mess, it really does simply wipe off.<br /><br />Because it's so easy to clean, I was also able to get some of the best parts of one of my old standby recipes to come out.  I like wrapping thin cut chicken breast around some kind of cheese and other fillings and baking it.  The problem with this is that some of the cheese inevitably leaks out.  Even on glass cookware, this is wasted food that I just can't get back in an edible form.  With this mat?  Nice crispy melted cheese fried in the oils that came out of the chicken breast.  One of the tastiest parts of the dish, and a new favorite!<br /><br />Cleaning up the dish above?  I cooked it on a 1/4 sheet raised lip cookie sheet, with no prep other than putting the baking mat down.  After pulling the food out, all it took to clean was an easy job wiping the mat off and then just basic washing to both the mat and the pan.  While some of the juices from the chicken did get under the mat, NONE of the solids did and it was just simple to do.<br /><br />The only downsize to this mat that I can find is it's size.  I want a bigger one, because I don't want to keep using cooking sprays and parchment paper.  It's perfectly sized for a 1/4 sheet baking sheet, but that's really what I consider a 'small' sheet unless I'm in the RV where my oven will only barely even fit this mat.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.<br />I've been looking for reasons to use the oven for this",B013TQS0DK,AHJGQR2GZD6WUPV3UA4NUMVMPHXQ,2016-04-01 03:25:12.000
5.0,Nice clay type hold.,"I have very thick hair for a guy and have a hard time finding a good product that holds well without being stiff.  This product is nice and will hold my hair well but still looks like it's not a helmet on my head.  It has a light sheen, and a medium strong hold, and fairly non stiff.  It also is smooth to put on, sometimes clays and pomades are annoying to go on.  And while it's not fragrant, it does have a nice fresh smell to it.  Not enough that you would smell it on a person but enough that your hair smells pleasant..  I would recommend this product to a girl or guy looking for a some nice hold when you want your hair to look more natural.",B00ZPQTVSQ,AE72CIMN37LEG7VYTOTRLDYKHGLA,2016-10-17 20:25:55.000

5.0,These are neat.,"We bought this to mix rubbing alcohol and aloe Vera for a makeshift hand sanitizer since it's so hard to find during the pandemic. These functioned perfectly and the extras were a nice touch.<br /><br />Pros<br />1. Hasn't leaked yet.<br />2. Easy to fill, easy to empty, easy to clean.<br />3. The toothbrush covers are a nice touch.<br /><br />Neutral<br />1. Larger than expected. Not a bad thing but definitely not pocket sized.<br />2. It's a bit difficult to control the flow if the stuff inside is a bit looser. In other words, it works better for lotion than it does hand sanitizer.<br /><br />Cons<br />1. I am worried about long term durability. These are bottles technically, but they're very squishy and don't have a lot of structural integrity. Don't put heavy stuff on top of it lol. This one goes in the top of the travel bag.<br /><br />Overall, these are nice little things. They are rashing squishy, hence the worry about long term durability. However, we put our hand sanitizer mix in there and it hasn't leaked out so I'm a satisfied customer.",B07Q4PXHZ8,AHTRLPO6Q7FNLBNB5SQSDPLC6I3A,2020-04-20 16:38:25.492

2.0,Less than Great....,"I really wanted to like this product, but unfortunately, it was less than great quality, and one of the brushes I received was broken. Quite a few of the brushes had frayed bristles and had uneven thickness to them, which made even application hard to come by.<br /><br />When I used some, it didn't seem like they blended the colors together well (mainly for eye shadow). I wish there were smaller round brushes for blending out shadows on your eyes because I feel like all the flat brushes are just about all the same. There is barely any size difference between three of them, and they can all be used for the same things so why not replace those with some rounder ones?<br /><br />I tried to contact the seller about the problems I had with this product, but, after two days, I haven't heard anything back from them. I was waiting before putting this review up to see if there was anything they cared to do to help with these problems (new brush that's not broken, or a new set all together that has better quality to them), but I have gotten no response back from them to lead me to believe that they're willing to do anything to help.<br /><br />I have attached photos to this post to show the problems I got with these brushes. The broken one was a foundation brush so I didn't get to try that one out to even see if it applied the foundation well, so I was a little disappointed with that. The larger powder brush seemed to do ok, but it didn't pick up powder that well. The larger fan brush I tried to use for contouring (I saw someone use a large fan brush for this purpose in a tutorial so I wanted to try it out), but even though the brush picked up the color, it didn't seem to apply it very much at all. The contour powder I used is super pigmented so I shouldn't have had that problem. The eye shadow brush I used (one of the smaller tapered brushes) actually worked pretty well so I don't have complaints about any of those except that some of the smaller brushes had frayed bristles, too. The smaller fan brush I used for highlight, and, though it did well with applying it, the unevenness of the bristles made it apply in a weird and uneven way, One of the larger tapered brushes I used to pack on a setting powder, but again, it didn't seem to pick it up well and left a ton of fall out once it hit my skin. I understand setting powder typically leaves fall out, but I've never experience so much before using this brush.<br /><br />Basically, the best brushes in this set were probably the eye shadow brushes.<br /><br />I hope this review helps give some insight on this product. I also hope the seller finds a way to fix the problems I had for future customers.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price for my 100% honest review. I tried contacting the seller (as noted above) before leaving this review since it's a poor one, but I made sure to leave enough information to work with and to help others decide whether or not they would like to purchase this product.",B01CF2W436,AFVJX6KGDCYR7ES5XFLC4WHHDDVA,2016-05-19 14:38:56.000

However, I wanted an iron to use on damp hair so I bought this and am so disappointed. Instead of 1-2 quick passes for stick straight hair, I have to do slow, slow 3-4 passes to get it straight, and even then it's frizzy. I turned it up to supposedly 450 degrees setting and it still doesn't work great. And my hair isn't even full curl, I'm touching up straightening from yesterday.

I‚Äôve bought other tools that just weren‚Äôt powerful enough to really do the job, they would take a light layer off but this gets right down to the new layer of soft skin. I cannot recommend this enough, I will never be without this the rest of my life. No more embarrassing comments about my dry feet as it allows lotions and oils to penetrate your skin instead of just sitting on top of the dry layer. This actually helps to prevent the hardened dry skin from getting so bad again. I use it once a week to keep my feet baby soft.",B007N47C66,AGHZC53JZQAQZM64CM4R4KIXINLA,2019-12-03 18:31:57.559

Each application goes on well and there is no streaking with either. There is no orange color or heavy tanner smell. The color itself looks natural and I'm fairly impressed by it. For the money this is a great bargin compared to others that are $30 plus a bottle that will maybe last a month. I'll keep using this since the color is so good and it's easy to apply.

2.0,"Proven ingredients, but a poor value","I‚Äôm not all that impressed with these products. Neither container lists the ingredients on the label, instead providing the ingredient list on a card that‚Äôs in the box. It shows that the cleaner is a 2% salicylic acid wash, which is a pretty tried and true formulation for treating acne. It is a low-lather, but still effective cleaner, but I didn‚Äôt experience any difference with this compared with other 2% salicylic cleaners that cost far less. It‚Äôs a fine cleaner, but way overpriced for such a tiny (0.51 oz) container.<br /><br />The repairing night cream is a combination of retinol (0.05%), niacinamide (3%), and hyaluronic acid (2%). All are proven performers, but again, it‚Äôs quite overpriced considering how low of a percentage of retinol is in the formulation. It does a decent job of moisturizing and did not cause any skin irritation. I am a fan of retinol, but the concentration in this cream (0.05%) is well below what I usually use (either 0.1% or 0.5%).<br /><br />While this product combo is on the right track, the value is just not there considering the amount in the container (one-half an ounce for each). While I would certainly recommend a salicylic acid wash and a retinol-based cream, there are many other options that provide these options at a far lower cost. Four stars for performance; 1 star for value; overall rating of 2.5 stars.",B08XR17DPQ,AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,2021-05-11 21:58:10.767

5.0,I'm thrilled,"I received these within two days of ordering. The were both packaged just fine no issues at all with that. The individual pots are on a handy case which holds all of them. They are numbered on the bottom of each pot, which corresponds with the card included, which has instructions on one side and pictures of each powder on a nail on the other, with  numbers. I used 5 different powders this evening, playing with all my new stuff. Four of them were double sealed, all had tape around the pot, but the holographic one did not have an inner seal. No significant powder in the case.<br /><br />Method used: prepped nails for gel normally with base, cured, 2 coats of black cured after each, one coat of no wipe top coat, cured, rubbed in the powder with the brush provided, another no wipe to coat, cure, then regular top coat and cured. They are gorgeous.<br /><br />I used the silver on two nails, red on one, green on one, blue on two, and holo on two. I used another company's product on the other three. This is the best holo powder I've used so far. It shows the effect constantly. The other ones went on easily and I am very pleased with my results, they definitely are chrome enough that if I go get a pedicure with them on, I can guarantee I will be showing the employees this product on Amazon. They will ask, call each other over, and ask again and again. So far every time I go in with a chrome or holo powder on my fingernails, this happens.  I'm not a nail pro, I just do them for myself, and I could not be more pleased",B01K5I3LS4,AEUNJELTRJPIIDOLVLBWO3QRQVSQ,2017-03-08 04:58:40.000

5.0,Perfect for Curly Hair Type 2,"I was introduced to this gel over a year ago. I absolutely love it. I have Type 2 curly hair and I am able to style my hair any way I wish. My daughter, who also has type 2 curly hair, often brushes her hair into a pony tail. The gel keeps hair from having fly-aways. I have short hair and use the gel to style almost into a faux mohawk. I pat down, comb down the sides and let my curls be free on top. Initially the gel has a light crisp. As the day progresses the gel no longer has a crisp to it and they are very natural looking and feeling - but I don't like when people touch my hair.",B01BV3KN2E,AGCUIDK5RT3ASA3CG6JXYL3IJ6BQ,2020-05-14 13:12:38.542

3.0,"The smell isn‚Äôt bad, but it is not good either","This is a very small amount of mud.  The inside dimensions of the bottle are approximately 1.5‚Äù tall by less than 2‚Äù diameter.  When I opened the bottle and removed the safety seal, the mud was to the top of the bottle.  The directions include a step to stir before applying the mud.  When I stirred it, I found there was a large air bubble and the bottle was only about half full.  A little of this mud goes a long way, so this small amount will go further than some other facial masks.<br /><br />As per the instructions, I washed and dried my face before application.  The AntiAging MegaMud goes on very smoothly.  It has a strong minty smell that becomes less overwhelming with time and is partially replaced with other smells that aren‚Äôt entirely pleasant.  The smell isn‚Äôt bad, but it is not good either.<br /><br />The mud made my skin sting immediately, but it became less intense until I washed off the dried mask.  I had removed the mask and I felt my face burning still about 5-10 minutes later, so I washed my face again using cleanser.  I was fortunate that there was only the burning sensation and not a significant amount of reddening.<br /><br />The box says the peptides relax muscle tension by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters released by the brain.  I'm not sure how I feel about having a topical beauty product interfering with my neurotransmitters.  I'm probably getting new lines as my brow furrows trying to wrap my brain around this concept.<br /><br />From the company website (https://www.viacosmedics.com/product/megamud/), this is a list of Ingredients: Deionized Water, Kaolin, Propylene Glycol, Montmorillonite (Bentonite), Glycerin USP, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Butylene Glycol, Carbomer, Polysorbate-20, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Acetyl Hexapeptide-8, Sodium Hyaluronate, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Extract, Camelia Sinensis (Green Tea) Extract, Matricaria Recutita (Chamomile) Flower Extract, Symphytum Officinale (Comfrey) Extract, Ananas Sativus (Pineapple) Extract, Cucurbita Pepo (Pumpkin) Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Algae Extract, Punica Granatum (Pomegranate) Extract, Calendula Officinalis (Marigold) Flower Extract, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Oil, Squalene, Eucalyptus Globulus (Eucalyptus) Leaf Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Caprylyl Glycol, Potassium Sorbate, Hexylene Glycol<br /><br />From the other reviews, I thought I would like this product.  After a certain age, many of us probably hope for that product that really will combat wrinkles and give us just a little more youthful appearance.  I can‚Äôt imagine spending over 20 dollars for such a tiny amount of product that makes my skin burn and may or may not have anti-aging properties.  For now, I‚Äôll just have to settle for having my beauty come from within.  Not such a bad thing anyway.<br /><br />The good news is that this product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.",B00Q5V41NK,AGEIW5MDFTGLGFPYLIQB2Y27BIWA,2015-11-03 18:14:38.000

4.0,These are great quality wraps,"These are great quality wraps. These are slightly bigger than the turban-towel thing I was replacing, which ended up being a good thing as my hair was getting too long for it. The button and loop keeps this securely on my head, and the microfiber just wicks a ton of moisture from my hair.  I also use these on my kids (ages 4 and 7) who want to feel like &#34;spa girls&#34; and they stay securely on their heads as well. This was a great price for two. I would have preferred a set with two white ones, but there's nothing wrong with the pink. The color hasn't bled or anything.",B0145XI8RO,AEIKLSAK254GZF3TYZUPC4ONTMHQ,2017-01-10 21:13:00.000

4.0,Good product for the family,"While I was looking for Charcoal toothpaste, I came across these toothbrushes and found them interesting. As my husband was looking forward to change his toothbrush, we decided to purchase this one. Good thing is this is a pack of 4 toothbrushes (including two small ones). The bristles feel good and gentle enough for the mouth. As they are soft and loose, he thought that they might end up in  staying in the mouth but this one did not do so. They clean the mouth perfectly not painful as well. We like the shape and lightness of these brushes.

He prefers the scent of the Cool Rush because it's a little more subtle but very clean and fresh smelling. I prefer when he wears the Overtime scent because it smells sporty and masculine. Either one would be a good choice because they both smell amazing and my husband says they both keep him dry and smelling great, which definitely says a lot because we live in the hot desert climate.",B00G7PCKI2,AFWBDZSBDUUMV7R7C4V64K6OZYAQ,2014-05-12 01:18:21.000

5.0,A solid buy,"I purchased the razor reluctantly after my other electric razor died. I had a cheaper model before that worked fine, so I really didn't see the need to spend a little more for this device. I am glad I did though, since having used this razor for over a month now, I can say it was well worth it. The features and quick recharge are nice. Being easy to clean is great too. But the best feature of all is the razor's perfect function as a shaver that hits every area, but is not harsh. Razor burn is a problem for me, or was. I no loger get it and this is a dry razor, you don't need lotion or water. I highly suggest this razor as a complete and comfortable device.

It is on the hardwe firmer side, which makes it a bit harder to apply. But if you use just a drop of almond, jojoba, or another type of carrier oil on the product or on your applicator to pick up--absorb the product. It may be easier to apply, as I read in another review. All and all, I do like this product and it's concept of many uses.

4.0,"Extends lashes nicely, but makes my eyes itch","To create fine, long lashes, this mascara does a pretty nice job.  Lashes look longer and natural.<br /><br />The primer has itsy-bitsy pieces of fiber in it that adhere to the lash and the comb aligns them to lengthen the lashes.  The bits of fiber kind of freaked me out when I kept thinking there were individual lashes sticking to the primer comb.  The fibers are part of the lengthening process.  With that said, I'm still not sure I like the idea of putting bits of fiber so close to my eyes.  The packaging says nothing about being ophthalmologist tested, hypoallergenic, etc., so I don't think I'd recommend this product to anyone with sensitive eyes.  After wearing this mascara all day, my eyes begin itching, and it requires more than water to remove.<br /><br />I really liked wearing this mascara as my eyelashes looked longer and feathery and very natural, but I'm concerned about the ingredients.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for this review.",B08GP7CV1S,AH63YMQRTZ7YNV6Z7PYZEZ4YQ5SA,2021-02-13 22:03:10.489

5.0,"If used correctly, it will scrub your back","I'm reviewing the back scrubber, not the ups guy, not the plastic it was shipped in, not the flavor of the scrubber, and not any other thing associated with the overall logistical process of the product making it to my front door.<br /><br />Great, scrubs as it should.  Couldn't be happier, description is accurate.  I expected to receive a back scrubber that could reach the middle of my back.  It is as it should be.<br />If you are looking for a rocket ship or the Swiss army knife version of a Loofah, do not buy this product.  If you have a hard time reaching spots on your back, during bathing and personal grooming, buy this. It will help.<br />I don't care about the packaging or how pretty it is, it arrived undamaged and had not been used by anyone before me. At least, I'm telling myself that no one before me used it.  I'm not sure how they test the product prior to shipping.  I did wash it before use.<br />So, in summary:<br />It scrubs the back well, there is a section that is a little rougher in texture than the rest of the Loofah.<br />It is not a rocket ship.<br />It doesn't matter about frivolous things such as packaging color or texture of the plastic it was shipped in.  It's a back scrubber, not a living room conversational piece.",B00YI0XFUU,AEGDBFUARDEFOKK5URLCU6CLS6MA,2015-12-17 17:40:35.000

5.0,Childhood Dream Unlocked,This palette makes me so happy because when I was younger I use to love CandyLand and always made me so happy when I played it.

My husband made the comment the other day that all the money he's spending on skin care seems to be working. I told him only till I remove my foundation. Sheer coverage but covers what it needs to. I wear a very light color & people can still see my skin spots but very faintly, so people think my skins just a lot better. I have lupus & have the mylar rash. You can't see it when I'm wearing this with blush.",B01JT98ZTK,AEVR5M5N77MK3SPUH7WFMTE5XI7A,2021-07-12 14:21:20.648
3.0,Thin ends,The hair is super soft and held color well. The thickness at the top of the track gets significantly thinner as you get to the ends so it looks really heavy at the root when installed.

The lotions are lightly scented, not overpowering, and I bet you could get away with using them at the office. The texture of the lotion is light, absorbs super quickly and doesn‚Äôt leave your hands feeling sticky. The tip of each tube comes sealed and the opening has a cute little flower shape. I totally recommend these. Each scent is wonderful and have the same great quick-absorbing formula. You can keep them all for yourself or use them as stocking stuffers.",B08LYVX8WG,AG4HKT5UNZGXVKERR62AS2G5HTXA,2021-03-13 18:58:54.407

2.0,Tinted spf31 face moisturizer,Lesentia tinted spf moisturizer.  This smells like old olive oil. I make soap so I know what a oil smells like when it is no longer good and this smells just like that. It is oily and greasy and smells terrible. It didnt dry out my skin but I couldn't wear it for long due to the oil smell. It seems to lightly give some tinted coverage but not much. If the oils were not so strong smelling and much fresher I think this might be ok to use. The expiration date is listed as being 3/31/22 so I am surprised at the low quality of oils used and that they are no longer very good.,B0855L611L,AGPGFWUIGJUZTOWTD35ZDAZLF3ZQ,2020-06-26 15:49:37.483

I actually add a very very small amount of Walkins Real Vanilla to mine because I like vanilla. Some would not. Never received any negatives. Never noticed any sticky but I put it below and in front of my ear and use talcum powder. My 2nd bottle and is not expensive for real cologne. Have you priced real cologne? This is a bargain.

5.0,Not the best gift for your 2yr old niece.,"This is a cold sharp piece of steel used for separating things into multiple pieces, mainly food.  This piece of steel works great if that is what you are looking to do with it.  If you are looking for a gift to give to your 2yr old niece, this would not be the best product due to the sharp edges, I would try and look for a piece of steel with less sharp edges if that is what you are looking for.  Hope this helps with you buying decision.",B000BC1RZY,AEBRDHNBYSVH5IPWQ5OUP5YQ3MQQ,2020-08-03 02:20:45.580

5.0,Nice color and easy to use!,"Bought the ""Dark Rose"" color, which worked very well on my medium long dark hair. My original hair is black with soft texture. Before this one I had the other color ""British Ask"" for about 5months. The color has pretty much faded and you can see the black and yellow-ish brown border line on my hair as shown in the picture.<br />Right after coloring, it looked like dark rose with a hint of purple under afternoon sunlight (see picture). The purple-ish color get rinsed off a bit time after time for about 4-5 washes. When it eventually stabilized, it turned into a red-ish warm dark brown after two weeks. This color can cover up light hairs and dye them dark so if you want bright red color then this is not recommended for you. I personally really like the final red-ish brown so I will buy it again in the future.",B07NPPK433,AFGQUXT5D7YMA4ILSXVAGZBHMMTQ,2020-11-25 17:14:46.747
